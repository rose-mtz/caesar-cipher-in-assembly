# Caesar Cipher In Assembly

This program encrypts files using the simple caesar cipher encryption.
The program is written in **assembly**.

I wrote this program to practice assembly, as I'm currently reading "Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett.

## Example Usage

To encrypt
```
./main  12 file.txt
```

To decrypt
```
./main -12 file.txt
```

Or you could do it in reverse to, negative number first then the positive number.

## To Build

```
make all
```
